Mid-Nebraska Makerspace Lab
---------------------------

Our vision for the Mid-Nebraska Makerspace Lab (MNM) is to expose students in grades 6-12, over 3-years, in an 11-county region of central Nebraska to STEM skills and draw on area STEM professionals to coach students on STEM projects, college, and career opportunities. 

To begin MNM this year (2020), 11 school districts in 6 counties which enroll 10,705 students in grades 6-12 have already agreed to participate in MNMâ€™s training and projects.  Schools include: Burwell, Centura, Cozad, Gibbon, Grand Island, Kearney, Lexington, Northwest, Pleasanton, Riverside, and Sumner- Eddyville -Miller.  Other central Nebraska school districts will join in years 2 and 3.
